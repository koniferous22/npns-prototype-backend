1. rename models to type-composers, export type composer with added resolvers
* Everything has to go to type-composer because mongoose long-term doesn't make sense
2. Permission scopes:
* auth
* validated password
* user activated
* prefetch (wraps everything)
* content owner
3. combine everything in schema.ts
4. test
5. husky: git hooks, typescript, eslint...



* add Type check and ESlint fix to pipeline
* resolving paths without index.ts

* DISABLE index creating on production db

FUTURE:
* Dependency cleanup
	* validator
* split queues into separate service
* db sharding and full optimization
* data archiving and lifecycle end
